You throw a die one hundred times. If it's 1 or 2 you'll go one step down. If it's 3,4 or 5, you'll go one step up. If you throw a 6, you'll throw the die again and will walk up the resulting number of steps. Of course, you can not go lower than step number 0. And also, you admit that you're a bit clumsy and have a chance of 0.1 of falling down the stairs when you make a move. Falling down means that you have to start again from step 0. With all of this in mind, you bet with your friend that you'll reach 60 steps high. What is the chance that you will win this bet? 

**Question:** What are the odds that you'll reach 60 steps high on the Empire State Building?
